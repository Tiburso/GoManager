## Goals

To be able to develop this project I will divide it into small goals.

1. The app requests user input and stores it in memory. It asks for the type of application, the company, the position, the date of application, the status of the application, and the link to the application. It will also allow for CRUD operations on the data.

2. The app will store the data in a database.

3. The app will provide a REST api. It will be interactable via a client like Postman or curl.

4. The app will have a web interface. It will be interactable via a web browser.
