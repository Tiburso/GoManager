## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Goals

The goal of this application is to learn Typescript, Next/React and CSS/Tailwind.

For that the development will be divided into three different stages:

1. [] The application will be static and will use vanilla CSS. It will already use Next/React and Typescript

2. [] The application will be refactored using Tailwind to be able to learn it.

3. [] The application will start using API calls to the backend already implemented in GO.
